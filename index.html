									<h2><a href="https://github.com/BisolaIbiwoye/No_Show_Appointment-Analysis">Project<br />
									No Show Appointment.</a></h2>
									<p>The dataset contains information about patients scheduling doctor's appointment in Brasil, 
									explaining whether they show up for the appointment or not. A descriptive analysis is performed 
									on this dataset to explain why 30% of patient missed their scheduled appointment. 
									Appriopriate visualizations were used to communicate findings and insights.</p>
								
									<h2><a href="https://github.com/BisolaIbiwoye/WeRateDog-Analysis">Project<br />
									WeRateDogs Twitter Account Analysis</a></h2>
									<p>This project enunciate the analysis and visualization of WeRateDogs Twitter account created 
									by Matt Nelson, the twitter account has over 5000 tweets which were made available in the archive 
									as of August 1, 2017. Appropriate python libraries such as tweepy, pandas, numpy, requests, json, 
									matplotlib and seaborn were used to gather, read, assess, clean and visualize the data. 
									The first step involved data wrangling, where data were gathered from three sources (Twitter archive, 
									a URL lint and Twitter API), cleaned and stored in a master dataframe. After the data wrangling process, 
									the curated master dataframe was analyzed and appropriate visualizations were carried out on the data.</p>
									
									<h2><a href="https://github.com/BisolaIbiwoye/Prosper-Loan-Analysis">Project<br />
									Prosper Loan Analysis</a></h2>
									<p>This project entails the analysis of a loan company's data, the data set contained 113937 entries arranged 
									in the rows and 81 variables partitioned into columns. Some columns were selected from the dataset for easy 
									exploration. The main feature of interest was the annual percentage rate (BorrowerAPR). The analysis was guided 
									by a leading question "What factors affects the annual percentage rate (BorrowerAPR)". Thus the relationship 
									between BorrowerAPR and loan amount, Prosper score, loan term, employment status were explored. I discovered 
									loan amount is one of the determining factors of BorrowerAPR, as amount increases the BorrowerAPR reduces. 
									The BorrowerRate structure is similar to the BorrowerAPR, BorrowerAPR is BorrowerRate plus other fees and 
									charges. The prosper score which is a determinant of credit worthiness influences the loan amount and 
									resultantly influence the BorrowerAPR. Most people fall under the 36 months loan term category.</p>
